# Type hints are part of this exercise. Only a couple of signatures below are
# annotated, as examples of the expected style - add type hints to the rest
# yourself. Watch the three cases from the exercise: list[Player],
# Player | None, and the forward reference "Team".
#
# The number and goals setters are given almost complete, because they use
# raise. A raise stops an invalid value from ever being stored, and it is how
# we say "this is not allowed". You only add the assignment that runs when the
# value is valid - and the type hints.

# TODO: Write the Player class.
#   Attributes (leading underscore): _name, _number, _goals
#   Properties:
#     number, goals - getters are given; each setter validates and then YOU
#                     store the valid value (see the TODO inside the setter)
#   Methods:
#     score(n=1) - add n goals THROUGH the goals setter (so validation runs)
#     __eq__     - equal if same name and number
#     __str__    - e.g. "Ada (#14, 12 goals)"
class Player:

        # Hint: assign _name directly, then use the setters for number and

#     add(player)          - append a Player
#     __len__              - number of players
#     __contains__(player) - support "player in team"
#     __getitem__(index)   - support team[0] and team[0:2]
#     __lt__(other)        - compare teams by total_goals (for sorting)
#     __str__              - team name, count, then one player per line
