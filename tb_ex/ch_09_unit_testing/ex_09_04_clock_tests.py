# file: ex_09_04_clock_tests.py
# Run this test file with pytest, not with VS Code's Run Python File.
# From a terminal in this folder:
# python -m pytest ex_09_04_clock_tests.py -v
#
# See Exercise 9.1 for an explanation of pytest test discovery.

# SIMPLE APPROACH USED IN THE BOOK:
# Copy these completed files from ../ch_08_basic_class_objects/
# into this folder (tb_ex/ch_09_unit_testing/):
# - ex_08_08_clock.py
# The ordinary imports below then work directly.

# ALTERNATIVE:
# Instead of copying, keep the completed files in their original exercise
# folder and add it to Python's module search path. Uncomment these lines:
#
# import sys
# import os
#
# sys.path.insert(
#     0,
#     os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..', 'ch_08_basic_class_objects')
# )
