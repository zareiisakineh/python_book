# file: ex_09_01_test_functions_start.py
# This file contains pytest tests.
#
# VS Code's Run Python File executes this file as an ordinary Python
# program. It defines the test functions but does not call them, so it
# normally produces no test results.
#
# Run the tests with pytest from a terminal in this folder:
# python -m pytest ex_09_01_test_functions_start.py -v
#
# Pytest discovers functions whose names start with test_ and runs them.
# After saving your completed tests as ex_09_01_test_functions.py, run:
# python -m pytest ex_09_01_test_functions.py -v

# Replace each TODO assertion with a meaningful test.
# The unfinished tests deliberately fail.
import pytest

# SIMPLE APPROACH USED IN THE BOOK:
# Copy these completed files from ../ch_06_functions/
# into this folder (tb_ex/ch_09_unit_testing/):
# - ex_06_01_taxi_fare.py
# - ex_06_06_ordinal_numbers.py
# The ordinary imports below then work directly.

# ALTERNATIVE:
# Instead of copying, keep the completed files in their original exercise
# folder and add it to Python's module search path. Uncomment these lines:
#
# import sys
# import os
#
# sys.path.insert(
#     0,
#     os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..', 'ch_06_functions')
# )
