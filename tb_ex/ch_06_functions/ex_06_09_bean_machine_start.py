# TODO: Write drop_ball(num_rows: int) -> int
#       Simulates one ball dropping through num_rows pegs.
#       At each row the ball moves left or right with equal chance.
#       Hint: start at slot 0. Which random call gives you either 0 or 1?
#             Add that choice once per row; the final slot is the total.
#       Returns the final slot number (0 to num_rows).

# TODO: Write run_simulation(num_balls: int, num_rows: int) -> list
#       Drops num_balls balls through num_rows rows.
#       Returns a list of length num_rows + 1 with the count for each slot.
#       Hint: create a list of zeros, then for each ball call drop_ball()
#             and increment the corresponding slot counter.

# TODO: Write display_histogram(counts: list)
#       Prints one row per slot showing the count and a bar of asterisks.
#       Example: "Slot 3 (107):  *****..."

#       Show the histogram vertically: bars grow upward, with the slot
#       counts and slot numbers along the bottom. Best viewed with a small
#       number of balls, since the height equals the largest count.
#       See the Extension section in the book for the approach.
