# Chapter 7 – Answer Key: Review Questions

## Understanding

**1. tuple vs. list**
A tuple is immutable — its elements cannot be added, removed or replaced after it is created. A list is mutable. A mutable object stored inside a tuple can still be changed. Tuples are useful for fixed collections of values. A tuple can be used as a dictionary key only if all its elements are hashable. Performance differences depend on the operation and implementation; tuples are not universally faster than lists.

**2. Single-value tuple**
`(42)` is just a number in parentheses — Python interprets it as a regular `int`. The comma is what tells Python this is a tuple: `(42,)`. Without the comma there is no tuple.

**3. Tuple unpacking**
Unpacking extracts elements from an iterable and assigns them to separate variables in one operation. The technique works on all iterables — tuples, lists, strings, and anything else Python can iterate over.

**4. The starred expression `*`**
The variable that receives `*` collects all elements not explicitly assigned elsewhere. The type is always `list`, even when unpacking from a tuple.

**5. `[]` vs. `get()`**
`[]` raises a `KeyError` if the key is not found. `get()` returns `None` by default, or an optional fallback value we specify: `get("key", 0)`. Use `get()` when the key may be absent.

**6. Dynamic dictionary views**
`keys()`, `values()` and `items()` do not return copies — they return live views that automatically reflect changes in the dictionary. Adding or removing a key is immediately visible in the view without calling the method again.

**7. Hashability**
A hashable value has a constant hash value throughout its lifetime and can be compared with other values. Python uses `hash(key)` to place and find values quickly in the dictionary's internal hash table. The key must be hashable for lookups to work consistently.

**8. `list` vs. `tuple` as a key**
Lists are unhashable and cannot be dictionary keys. A tuple is hashable only if all its elements are hashable. Thus `(1, 2)` can be a dictionary key, while `[1, 2]` and `(1, [2])` cannot: the former is a list, and the latter is a tuple containing an unhashable list.

**9. `remove()` vs. `discard()`**
`remove()` raises a `KeyError` if the element is not found. `discard()` does nothing if the element is not found. Use `discard()` when you are not certain the element is in the set.

**10. First four vs. last four set operations**
The first four (`|`, `&`, `-`, `^`) create a new set and leave the originals unchanged. The last four (`|=`, `&=`, `-=`, `^=`) modify the first set in place.

**11. `{}` is always a dictionary**
Python determines the type from the contents: `{"a": 1}` is a dict because it has a colon between key and value; `{1, 2}` is a set because it has only values. But `{}` is empty — no colon, no values — and Python defaults to dictionary. An empty set must be created with `set()`.

**12. `TypedDict`**
`TypedDict` lets us specify exactly which keys a dictionary should have and what type each value has. Regular type hints like `dict[str, int]` only say something about the types in general, not which specific keys should be present. `TypedDict` gives the IDE enough information to warn about wrong keys and provide precise autocompletion.

**13. `Counter`**
`Counter` is a specialised dictionary from the `collections` module where the keys are elements from an iterable and the values are counts of occurrences. It resembles `dict` most closely, but gives us `most_common()` as a bonus and sorts by frequency when printed.

**14. Requirements for elements in `Counter`**
The elements being counted must be hashable — the same requirement as for dictionary keys. The strings and numbers used in the examples are hashable. Tuples are hashable only if all their elements are hashable. Lists and dictionaries are unhashable and cannot be counted directly. The iterable argument to `Counter` itself may be a list.

**15. `most_common(2)` and `most_common()`**
`most_common(2)` returns a list of up to two of the most common `(element, count)` pairs, in decreasing frequency order. It returns fewer than two pairs if fewer than two distinct elements are present. `most_common()` without an argument returns all `(element, count)` pairs in decreasing frequency order. Ties retain the order in which elements were first encountered.

## Practical

**16. Unpacking and swapping**
```python
t = (10, 20, 30)
a, b, c = t
a, b = b, a
print(a, b, c)  # 20 10 30
```

**17. Extended unpacking**
```python
t = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
first, *middle, last = t
print(first)   # 1
print(middle)  # [2, 3, 4, 5]
print(last)    # 6
```

**18. Dictionary — countries and capitals**
```python
capitals = {
    "Norway": "Oslo",
    "Sweden": "Stockholm",
    "Denmark": "Copenhagen"
}
capitals["Finland"] = "Helsinki"         # add
capitals["Norway"] = "Oslo (updated)"   # change
capitals.pop("Denmark")                  # remove
print(capitals)
```

**19. Iterate with `items()`**
```python
capitals = {"Norway": "Oslo", "Sweden": "Stockholm", "Finland": "Helsinki"}
for country, capital in capitals.items():
    print(f"{country:<15} {capital}")
```

**20. Count characters in a string**
```python
text = "mississippi"
char_count = {}
for char in text:
    char_count[char] = char_count.get(char, 0) + 1
for char, count in char_count.items():
    print(f"'{char}': {count}")
```
`get(char, 0)` avoids having to check whether the key exists before adding 1. This is the standard pattern for counting with a dictionary.

**21. Set operations**
```python
a = {1, 2, 3, 4}
b = {3, 4, 5, 6}
print(a | b)  # {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
print(a & b)  # {3, 4}
print(a - b)  # {1, 2}
```

**22. Remove duplicates with set**
```python
numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]
unique = set(numbers)
print(len(unique))  # 7
```

**23. Subset check**
```python
a = {1, 2, 3}
b = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
print(a <= b)          # True — a is a subset of b
print(a.issubset(b))   # same, using the method
```

**24. `Counter` — letters in a name**
```python
from collections import Counter

name = "Mississippi"
c = Counter(name.lower())
print(c)
print(c.most_common(1))  # most common letter
```

**25. `Counter` — most common words**
```python
from collections import Counter

text = "once upon a time there was a little man who had a cat"
words = text.split()
c = Counter(words)
print(c)
# Counter({'a': 3, 'once': 1, 'upon': 1, ...})
print(c.most_common(3))
# [('a', 3), ('once', 1), ('upon', 1)]
```
