# Chapter 10 – Answer Key: Review Questions

## Understanding

**1. is-a vs. has-a**
is-a is inheritance — a subclass *is a* variant of the superclass. `Dog` is an `Animal`. has-a is composition or aggregation — one object *contains* another. `Order` has `OrderLine` objects.

**2. The diamond in UML**
The diamond indicates that one class owns or contains objects of another class. A filled diamond means composition — the parts cannot exist without the whole. An open diamond means aggregation — the parts can exist independently.

**3. What a subclass inherits**
A subclass inherits accessible superclass methods and class attributes. Instance attributes are created by initialization code, not merely by inheritance. The subclass may add its own attributes and methods and override inherited methods.

**4. `super().__init__()` and the consequence of omitting it**
`super().__init__()` runs the superclass initializer. If the subclass overrides initialization and omits this call, state established only by that initializer is absent unless the subclass initializes it another way. Accessing an attribute that was never created raises `AttributeError`.

**5. Polymorphism and its variants**
Polymorphism means that objects of different classes can be treated the same way but behave differently. Via inheritance: subclasses override methods from the superclass. Via duck typing: objects without a common superclass but with the same method name — Python does not care about the type, only that the method exists.

**6. `isinstance()`**
`isinstance(obj, Class)` returns `True` if `obj` is an instance of `Class` or a subclass of it. It is safer than `type(obj) == Class`, which only returns `True` for exactly that class — not subclasses.

**7. Abstract class**
An abstract class cannot be instantiated directly — if we try we get a `TypeError`. It defines a contract: all subclasses *must* implement the abstract methods. A subclass that does not implement all of them cannot be instantiated either.

**8. Composition vs. aggregation — syntactically different in Python?**
Composition models parts owned by the whole; aggregation models independently existing parts associated with the whole. Creating parts internally versus passing them in is a typical implementation pattern. Both use ordinary object references in Python — ownership and lifetime are design concepts, not distinct Python syntax.

**9. `__str__()` vs. `__repr__()`**
`__str__()` is for humans — readable output, called by `print()`. `__repr__()` is for developers — should ideally give a string that recreates the object, called by the REPL. Without `__str__()` Python falls back to `__repr__()`. Without either, `object`'s fallback prints the class and memory address.

**10. `object`'s default `__eq__()`**
`object`'s `__eq__()` compares identity — two variables are equal only if they point to exactly the same object in memory. We must override it if we want two objects with the same content to be considered equal.

**11. `__hash__()` when we override `__eq__()`**
Python automatically sets the `__hash__` method to `None`. This means `hash(obj)` raises a `TypeError`, and the object can no longer be used as a dictionary key or in a set.

**12. The rule for `__eq__()` and `__hash__()`**
For hashable objects, if `a == b` is `True`, then `hash(a) == hash(b)` must also be `True`. The reverse is not required — unequal objects may have the same hash. A class that overrides `__eq__()` may deliberately remain unhashable. If its instances should remain hashable, provide a compatible `__hash__()` and keep hash-relevant state stable.

**13. Iterable vs. iterator**
An iterable is an object we can iterate over — it implements `__iter__()` which returns an iterator. An iterator is an object that keeps track of where we are in the traversal — it implements `__next__()` and raises `StopIteration` when there are no more elements. An iterator is always itself an iterable.

**14. Behind the scenes in the for loop**
First `iter(iterable)` is called, which calls `iterable.__iter__()` — this returns an iterator object. Then `next(iterator)` is called repeatedly, which calls `iterator.__next__()` for each element. When `StopIteration` is raised the loop ends.

**15. A list can be reused; an iterator cannot**
A list provides a *new* iterator for each traversal. Iterating the same iterator continues from its current state — starting another `for` loop over it does not reset it. Once exhausted, it remains exhausted.

**16. What is a generator?**
A function containing `yield` is a generator function. Calling it creates a generator iterator; advancing that iterator with `next()` runs until the next `yield`, then pauses while preserving execution state. The next advance continues from there. A generator function may also use `return` to terminate. Python supplies the iterator protocol — we do not need to write `__iter__()` and `__next__()` ourselves.

**17. `yield` vs. `return`**
`return` terminates the function and sends a value back. The next time the function is called it starts from the beginning — all local state is gone. `yield` pauses the function and sends a value back but preserves the entire state: local variables, which line we are on, everything. The next time `next()` is called the function continues from where it left off.

**18. Generator expression vs. list comprehension**
A list comprehension `[x**2 for x in range(n)]` computes all values at once and stores them in a list in memory. A generator expression `(x**2 for x in range(n))` is lazy — it computes one value at a time when requested. For large datasets a generator expression is significantly more memory-efficient since it never stores the entire result at once.

**19. Multiple inheritance and the diamond problem**
Multiple inheritance means a class inherits from more than one superclass simultaneously. The diamond problem occurs when two superclasses share a common ancestor — a method call may be ambiguous if both superclasses override the same method. Python resolves this with the MRO (Method Resolution Order) using the C3 linearisation algorithm, accessible via `ClassName.__mro__`.

**20. `collections.abc.Iterator`**
`collections.abc.Iterator` is an abstract base class that formalises the iterator protocol. Inheriting from it gives us a free implementation of `__iter__()` that returns `self`, so we only need to implement `__next__()`. It also makes `isinstance(obj, Iterator)` work correctly for type checking — useful when writing functions that accept any iterator.

## Practical

**21. `Shape` with subclasses**
```python
class Shape:
    def area(self) -> float:
        return 0.0

class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, width: float, height: float) -> None:
        self._width  = width
        self._height = height

    def area(self) -> float:
        return self._width * self._height

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius: float) -> None:
        self._radius = radius

    def area(self) -> float:
        return 3.14159 * self._radius ** 2

shapes: list[Shape] = [Rectangle(4, 5), Circle(3), Rectangle(2, 8)]
for shape in shapes:
    print(f"{shape.__class__.__name__}: {shape.area():.2f}")
```

**22. `__str__()` and `__repr__()`**
```python
class Shape:
    def __str__(self) -> str:
        return f"{self.__class__.__name__} with area {self.area():.2f}"

class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, width: float, height: float) -> None:
        self._width  = width
        self._height = height

    def area(self) -> float:
        return self._width * self._height

    def __repr__(self) -> str:
        return f"Rectangle({self._width}, {self._height})"

r = Rectangle(4, 5)
print(r)       # Rectangle with area 20.00  — uses __str__()
print(repr(r)) # Rectangle(4, 5)            — uses __repr__()
```

**23. Abstract `Shape`**
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self) -> float:
        pass

shape = Shape()   # TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class Shape
```

**24. `Playlist` with `__iter__()`**
```python
class Song:
    def __init__(self, title: str) -> None:
        self._title = title

    def __str__(self) -> str:
        return self._title

class Playlist:
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self._songs: list[Song] = []

    def add(self, song: Song) -> None:
        self._songs.append(song)

    def __iter__(self):
        return iter(self._songs)

s1 = Song("Bohemian Rhapsody")
s2 = Song("Hotel California")
pl = Playlist()
pl.add(s1)
pl.add(s2)
for song in pl:
    print(song)
```

**25. REPL — iterator exhaustion**
```python
lista = [1, 2, 3]
it = iter(lista)
print(next(it))    # 1 — iterator is now at position 1
print(next(it))    # 2 — iterator is now at position 2
for x in lista:
    print(x)       # 1 2 3 — new iterator each time; list is unchanged
for x in it:
    print(x)       # 3 — iterator is at position 2, only one element left
```
The last loop prints only 3 — the iterator `it` remembers that it has already retrieved 1 and 2.

**26. `Color` with `__eq__()` and `__hash__()`**
```python
class Color:
    def __init__(self, r: int, g: int, b: int) -> None:
        self._r = r
        self._g = g
        self._b = b

    def __eq__(self, other: object) -> bool:
        return self._r == other._r and self._g == other._g and self._b == other._b

    def __hash__(self) -> int:
        return hash((self._r, self._g, self._b))

red1 = Color(255, 0, 0)
red2 = Color(255, 0, 0)
print(red1 == red2)              # True
print(hash(red1) == hash(red2))  # True

lookup = {red1: "red"}
print(lookup[red2])              # red — works because hashes are equal
```

**27. Generator `even_numbers`**
```python
def even_numbers(limit: int):
    current = 0
    while current < limit:
        yield current
        current += 2

for n in even_numbers(10):
    print(n, end=" ")       # 0 2 4 6 8

print(list(even_numbers(10)))   # [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
```

**28. `CountUp` rewritten as a generator**
```python
# Class-based, as in section 10.13:
from collections.abc import Iterator

class CountUp(Iterator):
    def __init__(self, start: int, stop: int) -> None:
        self._current = start
        self._stop    = stop

    def __next__(self) -> int:
        if self._current >= self._stop:
            raise StopIteration
        value = self._current
        self._current += 1
        return value

# As a generator:
def count_up(start: int, stop: int):
    current = start
    while current < stop:
        yield current
        current += 1

for n in count_up(1, 5):
    print(n, end=" ")   # 1 2 3 4
```

The class inherits `__iter__()` from `Iterator`, but still implements `__next__()`, updates its state and raises `StopIteration`. The generator needs only the function body: Python supplies the iterator protocol and handles exhaustion, while `yield` preserves the suspended execution state. The generator solution is shorter without changing the sequence produced.
